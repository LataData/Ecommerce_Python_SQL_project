1.Load e-commerce sales data into a MySQL database using Pandas
2.Connect Python to the SQL database using MySQL Connector to run queries.
3.First load heavy files into pandas dataframe then create and populate database tables 
4.Leverage SQL joins and window functions to perform advanced data analysis
5.Use Jupyter Notebook to visualize the results with Matplotlib, creating insights into sales performance and trends
